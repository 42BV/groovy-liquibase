# Groovy Liquibase
A pluggable parser for [Liquibase](http://liquibase.org) that allows the creation of changelogs in a Groovy DSL, rather than hurtful XML.

Presently a work in progress. The project aim is to create as close a match for the standard XML format as possible, such that migration back and forth is easy and very little new documentation should be necessary.
